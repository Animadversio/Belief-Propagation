    "A graphical model is a compact representation of a collection of probability distributions . It consists of a graph $G = (V, E)$, directed or undirected, where each vertex $v \\in V$ is accosiated with a random variable. The edges of the graph represent statistical relationships between the variables. There are several main types of graphical models:\n",

    "A Bayesian network is a directed graph where vertices correspond to variables. Each random variable $x_i$ in the network has an associated conditional probability distribution (CPD) or local probabilistic model. A directed edge from $x_i$ to $x_j$ captures a conditional probability of the random variable, given its parents in the graph, namely $P(x_i\\ |\\ x_j)$. Bayesian network defines a joint probability distribution:\n",
